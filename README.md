teensy3-ensemble-chorus

An effect for the PJRC Teensy Audio Library. This effect replicates the sound of a classic 1970's string synth ensemble chorus. There are two LFOs modulating three delay taps 120 degrees out of phase. The LFO consists of a 6.0 Hz sinewave and a 0.6 Hz sinewave summed together.
